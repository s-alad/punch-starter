# PunchStarter
PunchStarter is a blockchain-powered platform that reinvents crowdfunding by minimizing fraud and maximizing transparency. By leveraging milestones and a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), PunchStarter ensures that funds are only released when predefined project goals are achieved.

## Project Lifespan
In general, the life of a project will follow this order:
1. Get created by an author
2. Recieve enough "Up-punches" (up votes)
   * This a social vetting system; projects are only promoted to funders if enough people are interested
3. Authors can now setup Milestones with a deadline
4. If a project gets the requested funding before the deadline, it is then considered **funded**.
   * Funded projects cannot recieve additional funding
   * Funded projects are required to complete milestones.

## Milestones
When an author has completed a Milestone, they can request a vote from the DAO. The author provides proof (such as GitHub links, and demos). The funders can then decide whether or not a milestone is completed. If voters have decided that the milestone has completed, then the author can redeem the funding for that milestone.

Authors often will create a **Starter Funding** milestone without any deliverables. This is useful for projects who need some funding to get started, without requiring work to be completed. 

## Freezing a project
If funders decide that something fishy is going on, then they can call a vote to freeze the project altogether. If a vote to freeze a project is completed, the funders are refunded all of their funds that were left in the contract. For example, if 1 milestone was completed, that funding will stay in the author's wallet, but the funders will get all other funds.
